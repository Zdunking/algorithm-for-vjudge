### Descriptions：

```
The ministers of the cabinet were quite upset by the message from the Chief of Security stating that they would all have to change the four-digit room numbers on their offices.
— It is a matter of security to change such things every now and then, to keep the enemy in the dark.
— But look, I have chosen my number 1033 for good reasons. I am the Prime minister, you know!
— I know, so therefore your new number 8179 is also a prime. You will just have to paste four new digits over the four old ones on your office door.
— No, it’s not that simple. Suppose that I change the first digit to an 8, then the number will read 8033 which is not a prime!
— I see, being the prime minister you cannot stand having a non-prime number on your door even for a few seconds.
— Correct! So I must invent a scheme for going from 1033 to 8179 by a path of prime numbers where only one digit is changed from one prime to the next prime.

Now, the minister of finance, who had been eavesdropping, intervened.
— No unnecessary expenditure, please! I happen to know that the price of a digit is one pound.
— Hmm, in that case I need a computer program to minimize the cost. You don't know some very cheap software gurus, do you?
— In fact, I do. You see, there is this programming contest going on... Help the prime minister to find the cheapest prime path between any two given four-digit primes! The first digit must be nonzero, of course. Here is a solution in the case above.
1033
1733
3733
3739
3779
8779
8179
The cost of this solution is 6 pounds. Note that the digit 1 which got pasted over in step 2 can not be reused in the last step – a new 1 must be purchased.
```

### Input

`One line with a positive number: the number of test cases (at most 100). Then for each test case, one line with two numbers separated by a blank. Both numbers are four-digit primes (without leading zeros).`

### OutPut

`One line for each case, either with a number stating the minimal cost or containing the word Impossible.`

### Sample Input

```
3
1033 8179
1373 8017
1033 1033
```

### Sample Output

```
6
7
0
```

### 思路

```
给出两个四位素数 a , b。然后从a开始，每次可以改变四位中的一位数字，变成 c，c 可以接着变，直到变成b为止。要求 c 必须是素数。求变换次数的最小值。（a,b,c都是四位数字，输入时没有前导零）
依旧搜索题目
每次改变可以获得一个四位数c，然后如果c是素数并且之前没有出现过，那么我们把它放入队列即可。
