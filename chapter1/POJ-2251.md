## Dungeon Master

` 地址https://vjudge.net/article/187`

### Descriptions：

`You are trapped in a 3D dungeon and need to find the quickest way out! The dungeon is composed of unit cubes which may or may not be filled with rock. It takes one minute to move one unit north, south, east, west, up or down. You cannot move diagonally and the maze is surrounded by solid rock on all sides.   Is an escape possible? If yes, how long will it take?`

### Input

`The input consists of a number of dungeons. Each dungeon description starts with a line containing three integers L, R and C (all limited to 30 in size). L is the number of levels making up the dungeon. R and C are the number of rows and columns making up the plan of each level. Then there will follow L blocks of R lines each containing C characters. Each character describes one cell of the dungeon. A cell full of rock is indicated by a '#' and empty cells are represented by a '.'. Your starting position is indicated by 'S' and the exit by the letter 'E'. There's a single blank line after each level. Input is terminated by three zeroes for L, R and C.`

### OutPut

` Each maze generates one line of output. If it is possible to reach the exit, print a line of the form `

```
Escaped in x minute(s).
```

` where x is replaced by the shortest time it takes to escape. `
` If it is not possible to escape, print the line `

```
Trapped! 
```

### 思路

` 三维迷宫 `
` 看了半天才明白题目意思，L是平面数，出现的多个字符矩阵在想象时需要将他们叠加起来 以构成一个三维的地牢`
` 如果遇到最短路的话，首先考虑的是BFS `
` 广搜的特性是一层层往外搜，遇到终止条件就结束搜索，那么这里搜索的层数就对应了题目里的最短用时。`
` 深搜的特性是从一个点一直往下走，直到不能走就回退找另外的路。那么在这道题里即使找到了终点，你也无法确保你找到的路是用时最短的路，所以你需要枚举所有通往终点的路再进行比较才能得出答案。 `
